This repository contains the capstone project carried out as part of online course [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) designed and instructed by [Alexey Grigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev) and his team from [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/). This project is 2 weeks long and peer-reviewed. Idea of this project is to implement everything that we have learnt in the last 11 weeks of courseworks.

## 1. Business Problem Description
Kitchenware refers to a variety of products that are used in the kitchen for cooking, cutting vegetables, baking, eating etc. These products can include cups, glasses, plates, spoons, forks and kinves. 

Let us imagine a use case where you are the Head of Data for a e-commerce giant selling kitchenware prodcuts. A user visits your online plaform and wants to sell one of the mentioned items through your website. He uploads an image of his item into your website. 

We would like to improve user experience and orgnaization of items in your website by implementing an image classification system that can automatically categorize the kitchenware product uploaded by the user into relevant item such a spoon, a fork, a plate etc. User will upload the image and classification system will automatically tell whether it is a spoon or a fork or something else. This will allow the user to list his item in the website more easily . 

To solve this problem, we'll develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify kitchenware images into the appropriate categories. This will require collecting and labeling a large dataset of kitchenware images, and training a model on this dataset to learn the visual features and patterns that distinguish different types of kitchenwares. Fortunately a large sets of kitchenware data have already been colloected by Alexey Grigorv and is made available for everyone on kaggle. We'll use this dataset to train our model. 

Once we have a trained model, we will need to deploy it in the cloud , so that it can later be integrated into website and finally user can easily upload their items.
